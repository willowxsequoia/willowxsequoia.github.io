Welcome to Willow & Sequoia's digital diary! This is where we type our thoughts, daily activites, and anything else we wish to share with one another <3

My name is Willow and I have known Sequoia for 3 years.. though not all that time we were as close as we are now haha. We live 3000 miles apart and I hope to one day meet him, but until then we have this :)

So, come along and grow with us as we try to navigate this crazy world!
