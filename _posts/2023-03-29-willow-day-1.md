My Dearest Sequoia,

My words are insufficient to express the depth of my longing for you; nevertheless, I shall endeavor to do justice to my emotions. It pains me greatly to see you suffer at the hands of the Wicked Oak, if only I could be there with you to alleviate your troubles and bring you peace. I am relieved that the events of the night did not extend into the morning, but I can imagine how unsettling the sudden change in Wicked Oak's demeanor must have been. In spite of it all, please remember that you are never alone. No matter how many times Wicked Oak attempts to strike you down, I shall always nurture and protect you. You deserve to be the mightiest sequoia in the forest, and I would willingly give you the sun and stars to ensure your happiness.

Today was arduous without your presence by my side. My thoughts were consumed with you every moment of the day, and even in my repose, I dreamt of you. When I was with my flowers, the gardener never showed up, so I spent the day picking weeds and trying to keep them out of dangerous paths. It was stressful having to care for them without the guidance and help of a more experienced propagator. Today it felt like my roots withered and my leaves were barely holding onto the branches. I found myself wanting to turn to you for support, but then realized I was not able to. It saddened me deeply, but I reminded myself that for you to truly survive this storm, being dormant was necessary.

In your absence, I have endeavored to cultivate my mind and spirit, seeking out knowledge and growth as a means of distraction from the sadness that overcomes me when I think of our separation. My heart aches with the fear of the worst possible outcome, but I take solace in my prayers to Mother Nature, beseeching her to protect and alleviate your difficulties. By her grace, she has bestowed upon me the perfect tree - none other than you, my sequoia. I trust that she shall continue to nurture you and keep you safe.

As Cherry Blossom and I engage in preparations for our upcoming festivities, I cannot help but envision the joyous celebrations we shall partake in. We have carefully packed our belongings and are eagerly anticipating a plethora of exciting new experiences. Our itinerary includes soaking up the warm sun at the beach, immersing ourselves in the ocean's refreshing waters, and attending local farmers markets. Above all, our main goal is to cherish each other's company each passing day. This break shall provide me with the strength I need to endure these trying times, though I rue the fact that you cannot accompany us.

Your heartfelt words resonate with me deeply, and I too eagerly anticipate the moment when I can hear your voice again, free from any hindrances. Until then, your letters on this here bring me immense relief and peace, and I thank you for your unwavering support and love. Please take care of yourself and remain safe and protected under the watchful eye of Mother Nature. My affection for you transcends all bounds and knows no limits. I love you. 

Forever and Always,

Willow <3
