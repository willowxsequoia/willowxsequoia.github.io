My Pulchritudinous Willow,

I missed you so much today. I am so happy that you had a good day yesterday and I wish I could see the view you're seeing from the balcony, I bet it is so beautiful. I know the feeling of carrying bags up many stairs, as I have done during one of our stops in California. The elevator was sketchy and the door didn't open during our first load of luggage carrying, and the door wouldn't open so, we had to physically pry open the door and then it suddenly popped open because the motor then re-engaged. After that, we(my dad and I) decided to use the stairs, but since he was tired from driving, I ended up carrying all the luggage smh... it sucked. 

I cannot wait to see the pictures that you take and for our call tomorrow. I hope you enjoyed the German food at dinner. Our letters are getting shorter but that is okay because tomorrow is gonna be fun. 

Today was ice skating day and I was practicing how to go fast and to trust myself doing forward crossovers better. There were more people today than usual, about 50-70 people versus the usual 30-40, and most of them were new. There was this African guy skating and he was with his girlfriend and they were being so cute together(his girlfriend was feeding him fries like "here comes the airplane" and he just nom-nom'd it) and he had the whitest, brightest, and happiest smile I have ever seen. While skating in front of me, or rather beside me he messed up and he looked at me and sheepishly grinned. I smiled back and proceeded to skate further. After a few more rounds around the rink, I passed by the guy again and he called out to me, "Aye! Hey!!" I looked back and was like "Oh yes?" and he goes "Am I doing well?" and I said "yes you are doing amazing" he then says "better than the start?" and I was like "yes you are doing much better!" and he just smiled so big and it just made my day seeing him so proud of himself. I then skated a bit more and a little kid who was just up to my legs was like "oh my MOM! look at him, he is so fast!" and I was feeling so bad because I was not even fast LOL, it was funny though. After that, I basically overdid myself because I wanted to test my limits... and hurt my foot and so I rested myself till the skating session was over. 

We then went shopping at Walmart and my mom bought some sowing items, I got some apples, soymilk, and some bagels which were yummy. The Daves Killer Bread Blueberry Bagels. After that, I got home around 7:30 and worked on some math and now it is 11:20 and I have to sleep now if I have to wake up tomorrow and go to the museum early. I do have to shower though. I can't wait for tomorrow!

Lots of Nom-noms, 

Sequoia
