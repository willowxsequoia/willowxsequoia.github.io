title:  "Sequoia - Day 1: I really miss you :("
---

My most beautiful Willow,

I really miss you. Last night was crazy, Wicked Oak was at it again, vowed to cut me down and make me feel her wrath. I have never been so fearful of what that might entail for WillowXSequoia. I then decided to appease Wicked Oak's wrath by fulfilling her bidding. This process of appeasement came at a cost of happening to be a lengthy and emotionally lonely hiatus away from you. When we talked this morning, it was not easy conveying this message to you, knowing that you would wake up to a sad and disheartening message. It was unlike all our other morning calls and messages. Despite the separation that was sadly inevitable due to the unforeseeable and unpredictable circumstances that always surround Wicked Oak, you understood and for that, I will be forever grateful. I miss you, and I really love you Willow, you are the best thing that has happened to me in a long, long time. 

Later this morning, I was called upstairs right after we said our goodbyes and my heart was beating really fast, especially after what happened last night. As I was walking up the stairs and through the attic doors which I surely thought was the entrance to the gates of Hell, I prepared for the worst. To my surprise, Wicked Oak was not wroth with me, rather she was oddly conversational and proceeded to randomly talk about the ethics of investing in stocks(i know, very random). I believe she was indirectly trying to make amends for the heartless comments she said the previous night, in vain attempts to dissimulate her overall mood. 

This was rather frightening as I was on edge the whole time, still expecting what I thought was inevitable. Wicked Oak then pushed further asking for my opinion on certain topics to which I gave my carefully worded reply. At the end of the conversation, nothing happened much to my delight, and with great relief, I went back downstairs to my room and spent the next hour cleaning up my phone's history, logs, and everything and anything that I would be uncomfortable explaining the details of if asked by the Wicked Oak. 

After this, I remembered I had to use the Weed-Eater and trim the edges of the lawn from the previous day's mowing but I was unable to find the battery(the Weed-Eater) is electric. My dad then helped me find the battery and I set it for charging, I then had my breakfast of Oatmeal, Cabbage Stir-Fry, Moong Bean Stir-Fry, and my daily vitamins.

When I finished breakfast, I put on my outdoor "onesie overall" working clothes and got to work weed-whacking while listening to our playlist. After finishing that up I used our leaf blower to clear the sidewalk from all the grass clippings and then went back home and showered. I then got a little hungry but didn't want to eat anything so I, along with the now relatively happy Wicked Oak, worked on a coffee recipe that tastes really similar to a coffee alternative that we all love.

After that, I got on my computer and decided to share my day with you, as much as I could. I really miss you Willow, and I hope you are doing well. I wish I could hear your voice soon, but that all depends on fulfilling Wicked Oak's bidding. I hope to hear about your day/s as well. 

Love, 
Your Sequoia
