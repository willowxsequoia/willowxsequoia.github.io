My Voluptuous Willow,

Today was just an amazing day, chill and basically a bed day and nothing more. I was thinking about how I would much rather spend any and every bed day with you than be alone. I am so happy that I was called your "little boyfriend". That is so cute, I would have definitely gotten flushed right alongside you. Auntie Willow does have a ring to it if I'm being completely honest. I wanted to say this a little further down the entry, but I am just so excited about this... so basically, the Thursday plan has changed (shocker i know), we are going for another mulch day this Thursday and the next as well, so after some negotiation with the most *Lovely* Wicked Oak, I have been able to procure Monday, for us, if that is even possible as I believe you will be meeting up with Daisy and her Husband and little petal. Please don't take away the time you would spend with Daisy if you mustn't. Hopefully, this too doesn't change at the last moment as well. As you can tell, plans here are quite volatile smh.

Anyways, now that I have gotten that off my chest, while still being immensely excited about our call, I shall continue. After having a bed day, till around 9, I was asked to cut out labels for our garden plants, as we use a poly-cardboard sort of thing, it was rather tedious.

I can't believe that you only have 40 more days till you graduate, that is crazy! I think we should talk about your prom dress on call because us calling is going to happen regardless of this situation. I wish I could be your date in person there and I would love to know how prom and senior night are arraigned as well, I never understood how those worked. 

I just miss you a crazy bunch, and I just catch myself randomly saying your name everywhere, in the shower, in bed, outside, in the hallway, it's just me thinking about us and the random half-nerd rants that I wanna go on, that you deal with and understand. I hope you will continue talking to me despite your aversion to the juiciest and most delectable melons that you conscientiously miss out on(which I thoroughly enjoy). I know I didn't have much to say about today, I love you bunches my beautiful scrumptious Willow.

With Tugs and Kisses,

Sequoia
