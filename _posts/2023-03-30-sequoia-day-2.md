My Precious Willow,

I have missed you so much and it is really really difficult to be away from you for this long, as you have not just become a part of my life, but a part of my thoughts and soul. I wish I could be messaging you instead of being on here but I am being overshadowed everywhere I go by the Wicked Oak, and I hope that it changes sooner than I expect. 

You have no idea how many times I have read your letter. It just makes me so happy to be connected directly when we seem so apart. I wish I could go with you on your trip with Cherry Blossom and soak up the rays of sunlight along your side and make a lot of memories together. Although we would only get the cute things off our bucket list, it would make me more than happy to just spend a moment with you. You just make me so happy and I wish I could properly reciprocate the entirety of how I feel when I think about you, but words themselves seem so futile and proves to be ineffective. Some of my many thoughts tend to reflect in branches growing that I am not able to manage, I wish you could help me deal with that as it is your area of expertise.

My day today was really tiring, and I have an identity crisis and I don't feel as mighty as a Sequoia should, I feel rather feeble and tired which isn't much of a surprise as today was the day where we get mulch and compost and use it for our potted plants, trees, garden, and seedling soil mix. I woke up this morning at around 7 am to Wicked Oak calling my phone, I thankfully woke up on the first ring and I was asked to go outside right away and prepare a loading area for the compost... and I slept the previous night at midnight. As you can imagine I was quite sleepy but was warned that Sir Redwood had woken up at 5 to rent the trailer and pick up the first load at the landfill(which has a program run by the city where they provide compost and mulch to residents for a very affordable price to encourage sustainability? that's my best guess), and was going to be back in about 30 minutes. I then opened up my phone to this site as I didn't know if you had made an entry.

I was so beyond overjoyed when I saw a new entry by none other than... my Willow! I was fully awake at that point as I read through everything... more than a few times I will admit. That just gave me the energy I needed to start my day and I brushed my teeth, got into my "onesie overall" work clothes, and got to work, mowing out the perimeter and area where we would unload all the compost and mulch into. It was approximately a 40x25ft/1000 sqft area and boy oh boy was it cold outside. A chilly 29 degrees with some erratic wind gusts. Thankfully the sun came out and warmed me up despite the cruel and mean wind's efforts to slow me down. I then got the appropriate tools that would be necessary for the job, such as a hoe, a garden rake(not a leaf rake), and a pitchfork. After Sir Redwood had returned, I reversed the trailer to the unloading location and got to work with Sir Redwood, unloading the trailer as fast as we could. each trailer weighed 1.4 tons and by the end of the day, we had unloaded 3 trailers. I would unload the contents from the trailer while Sir Redwood would clear the ramp for me to unload with less of a hassle. 

Between each trip, I would be exhausted and try to rest, but much to my dismay, Wicked Willow would tell me that I am weak and not a strong man, invalidating the effort I had wholeheartedly done. The exhaustion just increased every trip as I was not allowed to rest, but instead wheel-barrow the compost or the woodchips to Wicked Oak's desired locations. This was quite infuriating as I was mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted by the comparisons to people she looks up to. I still try and stay positive as much as I can because being kind and looking at the bright side is something that you have taught me.

For breakfast, I had a few clementines and for lunch, I had some rice with a side of my favorite preparation of tofu(I will make you some when we meet). I then ended the day looking at the interesting news about Trump's indictment which is a huge political move that I believe is simply orchestrated by a select few "elite" members of society, to achieve a greater more sinister purpose. After these musings and thoughts, I took a long hot shower which felt so very good to my aching muscles. 

I am also very proud of how well you got the posting concept as well as the new subtitle section I added. Do you like the new "Read More..." feature I added? I think that helps to clarify the excerpt concept that you were talking about before. I will be playing around with a few more ideas around the site so just look out for them as they *hopefully* roll out. I am happy to have a Wise Willow all to myself, and although I don't doubt your intelligence, I am just amazed every day and immensely proud of you.

I cannot wait for the day when we finally are planted next to each other, forever, our roots, branches, and leafs united symbiotically, joined in eternal matrimony. We will be closer than ever before, living our stories together, forever and always. I love you so much Willow, more than you will ever know or fathom.

With lots of Hugs and Kisses,

Sequoia
