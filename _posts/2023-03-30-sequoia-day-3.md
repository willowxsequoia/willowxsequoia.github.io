My Lovely Willow,

It has only been three days since I last heard your voice and I'm suffering heavy withdrawals... it hurts. Without this diary to talk to each other through, I don't think that I would be sane, although I do feel like I am losing my sanity with each passing day spent away from you.

You were on my mind all day and it was a pleasant day in general and I was happy all day! Wicked Oak(I said Wicked Willow as a typo last time... I'm sorry) was being less of a thorn in my flesh which was nice for a change. So yes, it has been getting better here as far as today is concerned. I was sore when I woke up this morning around 9 am and woke up to your entry which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. I then brushed my teeth and had my usual breakfast of oatmeal, and cantaloupe for lunch(cantaloupe is yummy smh). As far as the work that I did today, I mixed some potting soil as we are going to re-pot our potted trees. The potting mix has compost, perlite, vermiculite, woodchips, peat moss, and limestone amendment, which was mixed in huge batches. 

â€œMiss Willow looks so pretty today!"- this is very true. I wish I could have seen you with your red bow because I can just imagine how beautiful you would have looked. I am also very proud of how your activity was a success along with the beautifully written review from the gardener. You did amazing as you always do! I wish I could have been to see the boys do cheer and see the dance routine. I probably would have died from all the sugar, but the popcorn does sound pretty dang good. 

I see you everywhere as well Willow, I was listening to a song radio on Spotify and everything was just me being so thankful that I could relate with. The love, and happiness that the songs talk about, I can relate to because of you, because of us. I have a secret that I want to tell you but I am sure you already know what that secret is.

Today I read something really interesting about Roman Concrete. In summary, Roman concrete is concrete that the Romans used which was a mystery, as to the composition. This year scientists found out that seawater and limestone were the ingredients that made the concrete self-healing. You should look it up whenever you can, it is pretty cool stuff.

I just realized we can call on Thursday when I am at the museum! I CAN'T WAIT, oh my goodness yes!! Let's just hope that Wicked Oak doesn't pull any shenanigans to stop that. I actually cannot wait for that. I love you so much my beautiful Willow.

I hope you are safe and not clumsy and accidentally hurting yourself. You are so cute, I am currently, as I am typing this remembering all the things we did on call, all the cute things and not-so-cute, but still somehow somewhat someway cute things. Wait... actually, you would be at the beach this coming week, right? Dangit. Maybe we can talk later during the day if and whenever you can. If not it is okay, we will figure it out. I can't wait to hear your voice again.

Lots of Love,

Sequoia
